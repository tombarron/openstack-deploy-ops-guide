##  Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and to maintain backward compatibility, we use the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) guidelines.

This means that each release will be pegged using the `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` format. It also means each release will follow these guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
