    <title>Description of FAS Systems</title>
    <para>
        The FAS family is a unified storage systems family with integrated data protection, robust data management, and built-in storage efficiency for virtualized, shared infrastructure and business applications. FAS storage is excellent for data management efficiency, virtualized infrastructure, shared workloads, and IT as a service delivery. FAS systems are often referred to as “filers.”

            NetApp’s OpenStack Block Storage drivers interact directly with Data ONTAP and are abstract to the specific FAS platform. Any given hardware platform supported by a version of Data ONTAP that in turn is supported by a particular OpenStack Block Storage driver will function. Refer to <xref linkend="cinder.fas.configuration"/> for more information on prerequisites for Data ONTAP.
