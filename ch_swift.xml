  <title>OpenStack Object Storage Service (Swift)</title>
  <para>
      OpenStack Object Storage provides a fully distributed, scale-out, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving and data retention. Object storage does not present a traditional file system, but rather a distributed storage system for static data such as: virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage, backups and archives.

      The Swift API proposes an open standard for cloud storage. It can also function as an alternative endpoint for Amazon Web Services S3 and as a CDMI server through the use of add on components.

  <para>
      Swift requires node accessible media for storing object data. This media can be drives internal to the node or external storage devices such as the NetApp E-Series storage array. This section provides information that enables an NetApp E-Series storage array to be used as the backing store for Swift object storage.
