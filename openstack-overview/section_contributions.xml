    <title>NetApp's Contributions To OpenStack</title>
    <para>
        A suite of NetApp drivers for OpenStack Block Storage (aka Cinder) are built into the Icehouse release of OpenStack available from <link xlink:href="http://www.openstack.org/software/start/">http://www.openstack.org/software/start/</link>.

    <para>
        NetApp has provided enhancements to the OpenStack Compute Service (Nova) and OpenStack Image Service (Glance) projects to enhance instance creation and storage efficiency as well. NetApp has also published a reference architecture for deploying OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) on top of NetApp's E-Series storage solutions that reduces the overall deployment footprint and replication overhead.
    </para>
    <para>
        NetApp additionally leads a development effort within the OpenStack community to introduce a new core storage service developed under the project name “Manila.” It adds a shared file system service to the existing block and object storage services, addressing a critical gap in OpenStack’s storage services coverage and enabling a new category of on-demand file storage based on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

    <para>
        Where possible, NetApp intends to (and has to date) contribute integrations upstream in OpenStack directly.  NetApp’s direct contributions to OpenStack date back to the Essex release.
